# Installation Instructions

## Prerequisites
Download the following files:
* WSO2ESB binary (e.g. `wso2esb-4.5.0.zip`)
* CA APM Java Agent binary (e.g. [`IntroscopeAgentFiles-NoInstaller10.7.0.90tomcat.unix.tar`](https://support.ca.com))
* The wso2esb java agent extension (e.g. `wso2esb.tar.gz`)
and put them all in the project directory.

Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

## Dependencies
CA APM 10.7 and WSO2ESB 4.5.0.

## Installation
1. Build an WSO2ESB base image: `docker build -f Dockerfiel-esb450 -t wso2esb:4.5.0`
2. Build the samples image: `docker-compose build`

## Configuration
* Set the environment variables `MANAGER_URL` and `AGENT_HOSTNAME` in `docker-compose.yml` to configure those CA APM agent properties.
* Change the `command` in `docker-compose.yml` to select the sample number you want to run.

# Usage Instructions
Start a new container with `docker-compose up -d`. This will execute the configured sample once.

To run the sample again or run manual requests as described on https://docs.wso2.com/display/ESB450/Samples run a shell in the container `docker exec -it wso2esb-samples_esb_1 sh`, then follow the instructions from the samples, e.g. `cd samples/axis2Client/` and run the command `ant stockquote -Daddurl=http://localhost:9000/services/SimpleStockQuoteService -Dtrpurl=http://localhost:8280/ -Dsymbol=MSFT`.

## Debugging and Troubleshooting
Check the WSO2ESB logs in `repository/logs`.
